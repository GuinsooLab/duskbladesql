The mzsql grammar, in syntaxes/mzsql.tmLanguage.json, is derived from
the original SQL TextMate bundle, available online at

    https://github.com/textmate/sql.tmbundle/blob/6d4edbc113d3272f7c097d6b1504624289ee2bc5/Syntaxes/SQL.plist

with the following license:

    Permission to copy, use, modify, sell and distribute this
    software is granted. This software is provided "as is" without
    express or implied warranty, and with no claim as to its
    suitability for any purpose.

That grammar was later imported into the vscode-mssql plugin, available
online at

    https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mssql/blob/50a2461aa2cb2fe3a307d7605be238856e4158ce/syntaxes/SQL.plist

and modified by various contributors, who agreed to license their
contributions under the MIT license, a copy of which can be found in
the LICENSE file at the root of this repository.
